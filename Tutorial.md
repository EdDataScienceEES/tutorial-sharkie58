# Mastering RStudio: Tips and tricks to become a professional codeR
## Fast and efficient use of smart packages and RStudio workspace

This tutorial was designed to help you to boost your confidence in R and RStudio by showing you how you can use RStudio to its full potential with simple tips, tricks and shortcuts, that are available either in RStudio itself or in several practical packages.

Let me start by saying that R is not the easiest coding language to learn and it might be that just like the rest of us, you are struggling to get a grip on it and need a little boost to help you learn to love it and maybe even make it a little bit of fun. The RStudio is an opensource software used increasingly in data science, but especially because of the characteristics and specificities of the language (don't use spaces in your file names!) is known to drive people crazy, frustrated and overwhelmed - and you might not be the exception! Your workspace may look too busy for you to concentrate or you just want to be a little faster in your command, so you can focus on the actual analysis you were supposed to do in the first place... right?

While these tips will not necessarily give you all the quantitative skills to become an experienced data scientist, they will make you feel as one, which is only a step away from the final transformation. With a little bit of luck, this tutorial will make coding less overwhelming and way more enjoyable. The material that I will be sharing are mostly quick fixes to make coding smoother and faster and if it gets too much at any point, you can stop and come back to it when you have more energy! This means the tutorial should be friendly for all kinds of working patterns and above all should give you motivation along your coding journey, whether you're a beginner or an experienced coder. It's designed as a resource to help you, so you can work through it on your own terms, one step at a time.

The tutorial is introductory level and can be useful to you even if you have only started on your R language learning journey, but contains information that can be useful even for intermediate or advanced R users! In fact, feel free to skip directly to any of the parts that you think will be most useful to you!
